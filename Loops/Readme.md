**🔁 Loops in Python (Basics)**

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.
They help avoid writing the same code again and again.

Python mainly provides two types of loops:

for loop

while loop

| Loop Type | Purpose                                 |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `for`     | Used when number of iterations is known |
| `while`   | Used when condition controls repetition |
