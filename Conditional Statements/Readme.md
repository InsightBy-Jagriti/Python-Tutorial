**Conditional Statements in Python**

Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions.
They check a condition and execute different actions based on whether the condition is true or false.

Python uses conditional statements to control the flow of execution.

**Types of Conditional Statements**
| Statement Type | Purpose                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `if`           | Executes a block when a condition is true |
| `if–else`      | Chooses between two actions               |
| `if–elif–else` | Handles multiple conditions               |

**Comparison Operators Used in Conditions**
| Operator | Description              |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| `==`     | Equal to                 |
| `!=`     | Not equal to             |
| `>`      | Greater than             |
| `<`      | Less than                |
