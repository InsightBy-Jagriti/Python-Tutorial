***Conditional Statements in Python***

Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions.
They check a condition and execute different actions based on whether the condition is true or false.

Python uses conditional statements to control the flow of execution.

**Types of Conditional Statements**
| Statement Type | Purpose                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `if`           | Executes a block when a condition is true |
| `if–else`      | Chooses between two actions               |
| `if–elif–else` | Handles multiple conditions               |

**Comparison Operators Used in Conditions**
| Operator | Description              |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| `==`     | Equal to                 |
| `!=`     | Not equal to             |
| `>`      | Greater than             |
| `<`      | Less than                |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to    |

## 🧩 if Statement 

The **`if` statement** allows a program to make decisions.  
It runs a block of code **only when the given condition is true**.  
If the condition is false, Python simply skips that block.

### ✔ Why use `if`?
- To check user inputs  
- To validate data  
- To control program flow  
- For simple decision-making  

### ✔ Key Points
| Concept      | Description                                |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Condition    | Must evaluate to True or False             |
| Execution    | Runs only when condition is true           |
| else needed? | No, it's optional                          |
| Use Case     | Single-condition checks                    |
| Indentation  | Defines which code belongs to the `if`     |

### ✔ Example Explanation
The `if` checks whether a condition is true.  
If it is true → the message prints.  
If false → nothing happens.
