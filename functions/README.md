## 🧩 Functions in Python

A **function** is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.  
Instead of writing the same code again and again, we define it once and reuse it whenever needed.

Functions help make code:
- cleaner
- reusable
- easier to understand
- easier to maintain

### ✔ Why use Functions?
- To avoid repetition of code  
- To organize logic into meaningful blocks  
- To make programs modular and readable  
- To reuse logic multiple times

### ✔ How Functions Work (Concept)

1. A function is **defined** with a name  
2. It may take **inputs (parameters)**  
3. It performs some task  
4. It may **return a result**

### ✔ Types of Functions

| Type | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Built-in | Provided by Python (print, len, type) |
| User-defined | Created by the programmer |
