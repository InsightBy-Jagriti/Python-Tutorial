***What is Input & Output in Python?***
Input means taking data from the user.
Output means showing data to the user.

Python uses:

input() → to take input

print() → to display output

By default, input() always takes data as a string.

✔ Example
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(name)

✔ Key Points

input() waits for user input

Input is always string

Use type conversion when needed

print() is used to show results
