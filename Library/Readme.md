## 17️⃣ Data Handling & Analysis in Python

Data handling and analysis focus on **working with structured data**, cleaning it,
transforming it, and extracting insights.

Python’s two most important libraries for this are:
- **NumPy** → fast numerical computing
- **Pandas** → data manipulation and analysis

---

## 🔹 Why NumPy & Pandas?

- Handle large datasets efficiently
- Perform fast calculations
- Clean and transform raw data
- Analyze real-world data (CSV, Excel, JSON)

---

## 🔹 NumPy (Numerical Python)

NumPy provides:
- N-dimensional arrays
- Fast mathematical operations
- Vectorized computations

### Common Use Cases
- Mathematical calculations
- Scientific computing
- Matrix operations

---

## 🔹 Pandas

Pandas provides:
- **Series** (1D data)
- **DataFrame** (2D tabular data)

### Common Use Cases
- Reading CSV / Excel files
- Data cleaning
- Filtering and aggregation
- Exploratory data analysis

## 🔹 Comparison: NumPy vs Pandas

| Feature | NumPy | Pandas |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Data type | Arrays | Series & DataFrames |
| Speed | Very fast | Slightly slower than NumPy |
| Best for | Numerical operations | Data analysis |
| File handling | Limited | Excellent |
