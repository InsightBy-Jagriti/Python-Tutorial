A variable in Python is a name that stores a value in memory — like a container or a tag pasted on something you want to use later. Instead of writing the value again and again, you store it in a variable and use the name whenever needed.

Think of it as:

🔹 Value = water
🔹 Variable = bottle where water is stored

You don’t carry water in your hands — you store it.
Similarly, Python stores data using variables.


📌 What are Constants in Python?

A constant is a value that is meant to remain unchanged throughout the program.
It is used when you want to store a value that should not be modified later.

Example in real life:

Constant	Meaning
PI = 3.14159	Always fixed for circle math
GRAVITY = 9.8 m/s²	Universal value
APP_VERSION = "1.0.0"	Version number of software
🔥 Important Note

Python does not have built-in constant support (unlike C/C++/Java).
Instead, developers follow a naming rule:
