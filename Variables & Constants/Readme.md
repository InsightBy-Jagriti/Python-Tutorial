A variable in Python is a name that stores a value in memory — like a container or a tag pasted on something you want to use later. Instead of writing the value again and again, you store it in a variable and use the name whenever needed.

Think of it as:

🔹 Value = water
🔹 Variable = bottle where water is stored

You don’t carry water in your hands — you store it.
Similarly, Python stores data using variables.
