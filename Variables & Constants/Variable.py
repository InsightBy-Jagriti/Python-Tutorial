# Variables in Python

# A variable stores some value — think of it like a labeled box.
name = "Jagriti"
age = 21
country = "India"

print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Country:", country)

# We can change the value later
age = 22
country = "Canada"   # updated value

print("\nAfter updating variables:")
print("Age:", age)
print("Country:", country)

# Storing different types of data in variables
score = 89.5      # float
is_student = True # boolean
friends = ["Aditi", "Neha", "Sakshi"]  # list variable

print("\nMore Stored Details:")
print("Score:", score)
print("Student:", is_student)
print("Friends:", friends)
