##  Modules & Packages in Python

A **module** is a Python file that contains functions, variables, or classes.  
A **package** is a collection of multiple modules grouped inside a folder.

They help in organizing code, reusing logic, and keeping programs clean.

### 🔹 Why use Modules?
- Reuse code across different files  
- Keep project clean and modular  
- Access Python’s built-in functionality  
- Shareable and maintainable code structure

### 🔹 Types of Modules

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Built-in modules | Already provided by Python (math, random, datetime) |
| User-defined modules | Created by the programmer (your own .py files) |

### 🔹 Importing Modules

You can import a module in different ways:

| Syntax | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `import module_name` | Import full module |
| `from module_name import function` | Import specific function |
| `import module_name as alias` | Import with a short name |

### 🔹 What is a Package?

A package is a folder containing:
- multiple Python modules  
- an `__init__.py` file (indicates it is a package)

Example:
my_package/
init.py
math_utils.py
string_utils.py
