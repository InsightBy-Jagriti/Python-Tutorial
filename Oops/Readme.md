##  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach that organizes code into **objects** and **classes**.  
It helps in building **scalable, reusable, and real-world-based** programs.

OOP is based on the idea of modeling real-world entities like students, cars, employees, etc.

## 🔹 Core Concepts of OOP

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Class | Blueprint or template for creating objects |
| Object | Instance of a class |
| Attributes | Data stored inside an object |
| Methods | Functions that belong to a class |
| Encapsulation | Hiding internal data |
| Inheritance | Reusing features from a parent class |
| Polymorphism | One function, multiple behaviors |
| Abstraction | Showing only essential details |

## 🔹 Why Use OOP?

- Makes code more organized  
- Encourages reusability  
- Models real-world problems easily  
- Easier to maintain and scale  
- Improves code readability

## 🔹 Real-World Example

A **class** is like a blueprint of a **Student**.  
An **object** is an actual student created using that blueprint.
