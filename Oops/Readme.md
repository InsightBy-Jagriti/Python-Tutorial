##  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach that organizes code into **objects** and **classes**.  
It helps in building **scalable, reusable, and real-world-based** programs.

OOP is based on the idea of modeling real-world entities like students, cars, employees, etc.

## 🔹 Core Concepts of OOP

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Class | Blueprint or template for creating objects |
| Object | Instance of a class |
| Attributes | Data stored inside an object |
| Methods | Functions that belong to a class |
| Encapsulation | Hiding internal data |
| Inheritance | Reusing features from a parent class |
| Polymorphism | One function, multiple behaviors |
| Abstraction | Showing only essential details |

---

## 🔹 Why Use OOP?

- Makes code more organized  
- Encourages reusability  
- Models real-world problems easily  
- Easier to maintain and scale  
- Improves code readability  

---

## 🔹 Real-World Example

A **class** is like a blueprint of a **Student**.  
An **object** is an actual student created using that blueprint.

---

## 🔹 OOP Topics Covered

- Classes and Objects  
- Constructors (`__init__`)  
- Instance variables and methods  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism  
- Encapsulation  
- Abstraction

## 🧱 Classes & Objects in Python

A **class** is a blueprint or template used to create objects.  
An **object** is an instance of a class that contains real data and behavior.

Classes define **attributes** (data) and **methods** (functions).  
Objects use those attributes and methods to perform actions.

## 🔹 Class vs Object

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Class | Blueprint or design |
| Object | Real instance of a class |
| Attributes | Data stored in an object |
| Methods | Functions defined in a class |

---

## 🔹 Why Use Classes & Objects?

- Organize code better  
- Represent real-world entities  
- Improve reusability  
- Make programs scalable and modular  

---

## 🔹 Real-World Example

A **class** is like a design of a **Car**.  
An **object** is an actual car created from that design.

---

## 🔹 Key Concepts

- Class defines structure  
- Object stores real values  
- Multiple objects can be created from one class  
- Each object has its own data
