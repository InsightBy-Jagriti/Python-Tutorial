**What is int in Python?**

int stands for integer.
It is a data type in Python used to store whole numbers.

These numbers:

✔ Have no decimal
✔ Can be positive
✔ Can be negative
✔ Can also be zero

**What is float in Python?**

A float is a number that has a decimal point.
It is used when you need more precision than whole numbers.

Examples of floats:
3.14,
0.5,
-2.7,
10.0,
99.99
 A float is simply a real number with decimals.

**What is a string in Python?**

A string is a sequence of characters enclosed inside quotes.
It is used to store text.

Examples:

"Jagriti", 
"Hello", 
"123", 
"Python is amazing"


A string can contain:

✔ letters
✔ numbers
✔ symbols
✔ spaces
✔ full sentences

***What is bool in Python?***

A boolean represents only two possible values:
✔ True
✔ False

These are used in:
conditions,
comparisons,
decision-making,
loops,
logical operations

Booleans help Python answer yes/no questions.

***What is None in Python?***

None represents no value, empty value, or nothing.

It is Python’s way of saying:

“There is something here, but it currently has no value.”

It is often used when:

a function doesn't return anything

a variable is created but not assigned yet

we want a clear "empty" placeholder

***What is complex in Python?***

A complex number is a number that has:
a real part, 
an imaginary part

It is written as:

a + bj


Where:

a → real part

b → imaginary part

j → represents √–1 (Python uses j instead of i)

Examples:

3 + 4j
7 - 2j
0 + 5j


Complex numbers are often used in:

✔ scientific calculations
✔ electrical engineering
✔ signal processing
✔ math-heavy applications

***What is a List in Python?***

A list is a data type used to store multiple values in one variable.
Lists are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicates.

They are written inside square brackets [].

✔ Example
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]

✔ Key Points

Items have fixed positions (index)

You can add, remove, or modify items

Repeated values are allowed

Supports mixed data types

***What is a Tuple in Python?***

A tuple is a data type used to store multiple values, similar to a list,
but it is immutable — meaning its values cannot be changed after creation.

Tuples are written inside parentheses ().

✔ Example
info = ("Jagriti", 22, "India")

✔ Key Points

Ordered (items have index)

Cannot be modified (no adding, removing, or updating)

Allows duplicate values

Faster and safer than lists for fixed data
